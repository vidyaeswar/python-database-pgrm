nstall MySQL Driver
Python needs a MySQL driver to access the MySQL database.

In this tutorial we will use the driver "MySQL Connector".( https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.)

We recommend that you use PIP to install "MySQL Connector".

PIP is most likely already installed in your Python environment.

pip install mysql connector
